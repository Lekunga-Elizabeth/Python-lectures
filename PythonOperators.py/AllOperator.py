# Below are the different types of operators in python with its example 
#1.python assignment operator 
w=10
print(w)
#s+=13
q=10

z=9
z/=3
print(z)
p=32
p%=7
print(p)

# 2.Python Comparison operators it compars two variable eg 
x=10
y=4
#equality operator
print(x==y) #if you run this you will have a false because is not true that x is = y

#greater than operator 
print(x>y)

#greater than or equal to operator
print(x>=y) # the anser will be true becase x is 10 and it is greater than y 

# less than operator 
print(y<x) #if you run this script it will be true because y is 4 which is less than 10

#less than or equal to operator
print(y<=x) # if you run this script the answer will be flase base on the exam[le above

# 3.The logical operators: there are use to compare conditional statements you can use (and, or 'or')
#. You have the and operator. it returns true only if both conditions are ture. otherwise it is going to be false
# Example below
foncho = 45
richie = 30
clovis = 10
miriam = 20
eliz = 5
# for the "and" operator we can print the below statement 
print(richie>foncho and miriam > eliz) # base on the example above riches is 30, foncho is 45, so in this case we will have the answer return as "false" because foncho is greater than richies

# with the "Or" operator either one of the statement is correct the answer will be true. but if both statements are not true the answer will be "False"
# e.g 
print(clovis<miriam or eliz>foncho)

# the not operators. it actually changes your statetate. if your statement is true it will give you a "false" answer and if the statement is false the answer will be true
