#working with while loop in python alway declare your count  
# you can write your while loop in 2 methods 
# method 1 is 
count=1
while(count<3):
    count=count+1
    print('hey elizabeth')
    
# method 2 with is the short cut to write the same code in mothed 1 do 
while(count<5): count+=1; print('hey elizabeth welcome')

elizabeth=1
while(elizabeth<5):
    print('hello')
    elizabeth = elizabeth +1
    
# Printing in decending other in while loop e.g from 10 to 1 instead of 1 to 10 we have to used '-' instead of '+'
count=10
while count >=1:
      count -=1
      print(count)

#exer3 working with condition (print even numbers and odd numbers 0 to 10)
num=10
while num >
