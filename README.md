# Python-lectures

in this lectures we have done basic operation in maths 
and also did some input function 

what we have actually understand today is that when calling a user to give you an input use the following command 
value = (input ("write what you want to get from the useer here"))
the value here can be anything e.g name, number or anything

we have covered the following topics 
1. basic syntaxs in Python
2. Operations 
3. Data types and conditional statements 





Steps to implement

1. Prompt the user to enter the number of questions on the exam, the number of questions the student answered correctly, and the number of points each question is worth.

2. Calculate the total number of points the student earned on the exam by multiplying the number of questions the student answered correctly by the number of points each question is worth.

3. Calculate the maximum number of points the student could have earned on the exam by multiplying the total number of questions by the number of points each question is worth.

4. Calculate the student's grade as a percentage by dividing the total number of points the student earned by the maximum number of points they could have earned, and multiplying by 100.

5. Use conditional statements to check if the student passed or failed the exam. If the student's grade is 50% or higher, print a message indicating that the student passed the exam. If the student's grade is below 50%, print a message indicating that the student failed the exam.



Things I wish I listened to when I started my programming journey. 

1. Learn how to document.
   No matter the size of the application you have built,  please have a documentation for it. The documentation should clearly define the following components. 
   • How to run the software: clearly define how the software should be started and the processes and dependencies it will need. 
   • Technical documentation: define the purpose of each file and directory structure and general code philosophy and any thing you would want a developer to take note of

2. Learn how to read documentation. 
   Reading documentation of a framework or library is very daunting, in the eyes of a beginner it looks like a waste of time. But I have to tell you that forcing yourself to read documentation is the best thing you can do.  Don't let all your knowledge of a framework come from videos alone. You will be Suprised that you only know about 8% of the Framework, library or language if you do so. 

3. Enjoy the process. 
   The goal is not to write functioning code, the goal is to understand what makes the code function. 
   When you see a bug don't just go around cutting and pasting code snippets in order to get rid of the error.
   Follow this framework in order to debug without feeling a slight headache. 
   • Research why this error exists
   • research the possible causes of such errors
   • Try to understand what you did that might have prompted that error
   • Test other scenarios. 
   • Read documentation
   • solve the bug
   • re-create the bug in order to fully understand what you are doing. 

4. Every language or framework is a tool. 
   Every technology out there is built to serve a purpose. There is no need for language or framework hate. There is no need to talk down on any technology.
    Technology are tools, use the one that most suits the job. Don't get emotional in tech. If what you currently know can't do the job, the best thing to do is to upgrade your knowledge maybe to a new framework or language. 
   A carpenter doesn't get emotional over the hammer not being able to do the work of a saw. 

5. It will take time. 
    You can't start learning today and hope to be an expert in a few weeks. People go to school for 13 years and they can't still call themselves experts in their field. Take your time to learn. Take your time to understand. It not easy out there. If it was easy everyone would be doing it. 

Discipline achieves more than flickering motivation.
