# working with conditional statements 

# the if statement  examples in this example we use the equality operator (==) since we want to fine out if a is  equall to b the same
a=10
b=5
if(a==b):
    print("Lekungae is a big Devops Engineer!")
else:
    print("Clovis is a bigger Engineer")
    
# three statements with elif
x,y = 20,40

if(x>y):
    print(x, "is greater than", y)
elif x==y:
    print("x and y are equal")
else:
    print("y is greater than x")
